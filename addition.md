If you have one number, such as 1, you can take that number and add it to another number, such as 2, and get 3. 
The way you know 1 plus 2 is 3 is this:
if you have *one egg* and find *two more eggs* and pick them up, you now have *three eggs* total in your hand.
Another example would be adding 0 to 1:
When you have *zero* of something, if you add *one* of something to that, you will have a total of *one* thing.
If you multiply 8 by 7, you get 56.
